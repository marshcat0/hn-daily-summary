      "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI see a lot of designers who won’t touch code until a Figma file is perfect. Every spacing tweak, every breakpoint mocked up, every state designed before anything exists in a browser. Meanwhile, whenever I start code-first, things feel faster and more honest. Real constraints, real layout behavior, fewer fake-perfect designs that fall apart once implemented.\n\nObviously Figma is great for collaboration and client sign-off. But I’m starting to think using it as the starting point trains people to design things that don’t actually want to exist on the web.\n\nCurious where people land on this now. Figma-first always? Code-first always? Or does it just depend and everyone arguing is tired?"

It would be amazing if you could share some of your experiences in getting started with typography or type design if you have any experience with it at all.\n\nWhether you’re somebody who’s just a user of typography and fonts, have experience creating your own, or have attempted but bounced off quickly, I’d really appreciate hearing about\n\n\\- What parts felt/feel difficult, confusing, or frustrating\n\n\\- What tools you tried (if any) and why you stopped or kept going\n\n\\- What would have made the experience smoother or easier\n\nAny response at all would be really appreciated, thank you!"

The client *must* tick boxes (e.g., \"I have verified the mobile view\", \"I checked spelling\") before the \"Approve\" button even unlocks.\n\nAgency Branding: You can upload your own agency logo so the portal looks like *yours*, not a generic tool.\n\nAudit Logs: It creates a timestamped record of exactly who approved what and when. (Great for \"Cover Your Ass\" if they change their mind later).\n\nI am looking for a few freelancers or agency owners to try it out and tell me if it's actually useful to your workflow.\n\nIt is currently free to use.\n\nIf you are interested, let me know in the comments and I will share the link."
