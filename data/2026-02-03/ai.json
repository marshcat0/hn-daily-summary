No API calls for voice synthesis = unlimited generations, zero cost.\n\nBasically: ElevenLabs-style voice cloning + NotebookLM-style podcast generation, but local.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/bc-dunia/qwen3-TTS-studio](https://github.com/bc-dunia/qwen3-TTS-studio)\n\nHappy to answer any questions!"

In ML, we often encounter similar issues—parameters with symmetries, non-Euclidean spaces, data living on manifolds, generalization effects that feel global rather than local—but we usually address them heuristically rather than structurally.\n\nI’m not claiming that abstract math automatically leads to better models. Most ideas don’t survive contact with practice. But when some do, they often enable qualitatively different behavior rather than incremental improvements.\n\nI’m now trying to move closer to ML-adjacent geometry: geometric deep learning beyond graphs, Riemannian optimization, symmetry and equivariance, topology-aware learning.\n\nI’d be very interested in pointers to work (books, lecture notes, papers, or practical case studies) that sits between **modern geometry/topology and modern ML**, especially answers to questions like:\n\n* which geometric ideas have actually influenced model or optimizer design beyond toy settings?\n* where does Riemannian or manifold-aware optimization help in practice, and where is it mostly cosmetic?\n* which topological ideas seem fundamentally incompatible with SGD-style training?\n\nPointers and critical perspectives are very welcome."

For those who haven't seen it, it's a gradient boosting machine (GBM) written in Rust that eliminates the need for hyperparameter optimization by using a generalization algorithm controlled by a single \"budget\" parameter.\n\nThis update focuses on performance, stability, and ecosystem integration.\n\nKey Technical Updates:\n- Performance: up to 2x faster training.\n- Ecosystem: Full R release, ONNX support, and native \"Save as XGBoost\" for interoperability.\n- Python Support: Added Python 3.14, dropped 3.9.\n- Data Handling: Zero-copy Polars support (no memory overhead).\n- API Stability: v1.0.0 is now the baseline, with guaranteed backward compatibility for all 1.x.x releases (compatible back to v0.10.0).\n\nBenchmarking against LightGBM + Optuna typically shows a 100x wall-time speedup to reach the same accuracy since it hits the result in a single run.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual\n\nWould love to hear any feedback or answer questions about the algorithm!\n"

      "text": "I'm working in machine learning- application field. There are very few references which apply machine learning framework in my field of interest. So, even if I have comparison results of our framework with *one* baseline, I am unable to find more methods that solve the problem I am interested in.\n\nI see there is an in-depth comparision analysis provided in the machine learning conference papers. How to manage my analysis work with very few comparison results? I can perform additional experiments in even higher dimensions, but other than that, I'm unsure how to proceed from there.\n\nI would appreciate any advice and suggestions to move forward in such situation. Thank you in advance."
